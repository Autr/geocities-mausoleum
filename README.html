<h1 id="theshapeofdeathtocome">The Shape Of Death To Come</h1>

<p>Originally entitled &#8220;Beverly Hills Internet&#8221;, Geocities was the first mass-use free web hosting service, popularised shortly. Before to create their own websites, or homesteads, via WYSIWYG editors and inline HTML. </p>

<p>By 1997 Geocities was the fifth most visited site in the world and contained over 100,000 user-built websites, later 38 million user-built webpages.
In 1999, it had been bought by Yahoo for <sub>3</sub>.57 billion in stock. and by 2001, after the dot-com bubble had burst, declared at an 8 million dollar loss.</p>

<p>For many, their first and sometimes only website was created with Geocities. Their function was akin to scrapbooks, messages in bottles, or string and glue constructions. In later years, Geocities has become almost folkloric. Years later I would come across a book called <a href="http://digital-folklore.org/">Digital Folklore</a> which celebrated the DIY aesthetic and strange creative outpouring from this epochal point in time. The term folklore seemed fitting in denoting that idealistic vision of the internet’s possibilities - informal exchanges of knowledge, and attempts at creating a shared sense of the world.</p>

<p>The speculative dreams of a <a href="http://contemporary-home-computing.org/vernacular-web-2/">vernacular web</a> of non-institutional communication, without “sickness, death or burial” would become Youtube, upvoting embedded share buttons. Things were not things, but content, and emotional analytics derived value where there had been none before. This time regulated spaces where the freedom to create and disseminate were sought-after metrics. For the of Yahoo, perhaps sensing the shift, the old world of MIDI, GIFs and guestbooks was a relic, if not embarassement.</p>

<p>which meant that when Yahoo announced it would be deleting the platform tech-commentariat reaction varied only from &#8220;good riddance&#8221; to &quot;does that still exist?”.</p>

<p>Geocities was deleted unceremoniously in.</p>

<p>Jason Scott of the <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org/index.php?title=Main_Page">Archive Team</a> reports that contact with Yahoo was rebuffed and then fizzled out as workers were moved between departments. In an effort of last resort bots were written and scraped Geocities from it&#8217;s servers in raw HTTP form, then pieced together into a freely accessible <a href="https://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6353395/Geocities_-_The_PATCHED_Torrent">archival torrent</a> 641.32 gigabytes in size.</p>

<p>Running queries against these it is possible to discover many thousands of digital epitaphs and memorials, which are recreated in this website. Here the utopian visions of ___ are often reflected in the assumptions of their creators that they would be a permanent epitaph in an otherwise impermanent world.</p>

<p>Beyond, few eyelids have been batted at the prospect of deleting 38 million user-created pages, lesser the rapid devaluation a resource from 3.5 billion dollars. In digital life there are perhaps many approximations of death and burial, and also desecration.</p>
