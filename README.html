<blockquote>
<p>Founded in 1994 and originally named Beverly Hills Internet, Geocities was the first mass-use free web hosting service, providing 15MB space to build and customise websites - or homesteads - using WYSIWYG editors and inline HTML. </p>
<p>By 1997 Geocities had become the 3rd most visited site in the world and contained over 100,000 user-built websites, later growing to 38 million websites. In 1999, it was bought by Yahoo for 3.57 billion dollars during the height of dot-com speculation, and 2 years later, valued at 8 million dollars prior to the dot-com crash of 2000/2001.</p>
<p>For early users of the internet, Geocities was also often the first and only website created. Predominantly North American, the skeumorphic websites of this era often reflect utopian ideals: informal and non-institutional communication, a “<a href="http://contemporary-home-computing.org/vernacular-web-2/">vernacular web</a>” without “<a href="http://art.teleportacia.org/observation/vernacular/">sickness, death or burial</a>”. </p>
<p>By the late 2000s however this old world of MIDI and GIFs had come to be seen is a relic, if not embarassment for Yahoo. Talk shifted Web 2.0, signalling a shift toward metadata markets better served by gated platforms and analytics. In 2009, Yahoo announced it would be removing Geocities from the internet.</p>
<p>Pre-empting this change, archivists organised to preserve Geocities: at first with attempted cooperation from Yahoo, then via scripted bots. Partially scraped in it’s entirety, resources include the <a href="https://thepiratebay.org/description.php?id=5923737">Archive Team torrent</a>, and online mirrors such as <a href="http://geocities.ws/archive/">Geocities Archive Project</a>, Retrocities, <a href="https://www.oocities.org">Oocities</a> and Internet Archaeology. Here it is possible to discover many thousands of user-created digital epitaphs and memorials. </p>
<p>The sites reproduced here reflect popular internet use at the turn of the millenium, and in many, an assumption by their creators of a permanent epitaph in an otherwise impermanent world. </p>
<p>In digital life there are perhaps many approximations of death and burial, and also desecration.</p>
